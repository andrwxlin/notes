\section{Introduction}
There are different forms of energy because there are different kinds of forces. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gravitational energy
    \item Elastic energy
    \item Thermal energy
    \item Radiant energy
    \item Electrical energy
    \item Nuclear energy
    \item Mass energy
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Force} is an agent of change, \textbf{energy} is often defined as the ability to do work, and \textbf{work} is one way of transferring energy from one system to another.
\end{definition}
The \textbf{Law of Conservation of Energy} (aka the \textbf{First Law of Thermodynamics}) says that if you account for all its various forms, the total amount of energy in a given process will stay constant (\textit{conserved}).

\section{Work}
\begin{definition}
    Work is the energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement.
\end{definition}
If \textbf{F} is the force, and $d \textbf{\textit{x}}$ is an infinitesimal amount of displacement, then the work done is:
\begin{equation*}
    W = \int \textbf{F} \cdot d \textbf{\textit{x}}
\end{equation*}
If \textbf{F} is constant, then it can be removed from the integral, and since $\textbf{F} \cdot \textbf{r} = (F\cos\theta)r$ for any angle $\theta$, then $W = (F\cos\theta)r$.
\begin{unit}
    The unit of work is the newton-meter (N $\cdot$ m), which is also called a joule (J).
\end{unit}
\newpage
\begin{note}
    Though work depends on two vectors (\textbf{F} and \textbf{r}), work itself is \textit{not} a vector. \\
This is a result of the dot product, whereby two vectors are multiplied to produce a scalar. Another result of the dot product is that only the component of the force that is parallel (or antiparallel) to the displacement does any work.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
    Any force or component of a force that is perpendicular to the direction that an object actually moves cannot do work because the displacement in that direction is zero.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
    If a graph of force as a function of position or displacement is given, the work done by the force is the definite integral whose boundaries correspond to the displacement, $\Delta x$.
\end{note}

\section{Kinetic Energy}
\begin{definition}
    Kinetic energy, denoted by $K$, is the energy an object has by virtue of its motion.
\end{definition}
Consider an object at rest ($v_{0} = 0$) with mass $m$ and a steady force \textbf{F} is being exerted on it, pushing it in a straight line. The object's acceleration is $a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m}$, so after travelling distance $\Delta x$ under the force, its final speed $v$ is:
\begin{equation*}
    v^{2} = v_{0}^2 + 2a(x-x_{0})=2a \Delta x = 2 \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m} \Delta x \space \Rightarrow \space F_{\text{net}} \Delta x = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}
\end{equation*}
\begin{note}
    This equation is given by the Big Five \#5.
\end{note}
But the quantity $F_{net} \Delta x$ is the \textbf{total work} done by the force, so $W_{r} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$. The work done on the object has transferred energy to it, in the amount $\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$. \\
The energy an object possesses by  virtue of its motion is therefore defined as $\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$ and is called \textbf{kinetic energy}:
\begin{equation*}
    K = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}
\end{equation*}
\begin{unit}
    Kinetic energy is expressed in joules.
\end{unit}
\begin{note}
    Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity.
\end{note}

\newpage
\section{The Work-Energy Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
    The total work done on an object --- equivalently, the work done by the net force --- will equal its change in kinetic energy:
    \begin{equation*}
        W_{\text{total}} = \Delta K
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{note}
        This is the extension of the derivation in Section 3 (Kinetic Energy) to an object with a non-zero initial speed.
    \end{note}
\end{theorem}

\section{Potential Energy}
\begin{definition}
    Potential energy, denoted by $U$, is the energy an object has by virtue of its position.
\end{definition}
\begin{note}
    Potential energy is independent of motion.
\end{note}
Because there are different types of forces, there are different types of potential energy.
\subsection{Gravitational Potential Energy}
\begin{definition}
    Gravitational potential energy, denoted by $U_{\text{grav}}$, is the energy stored by virtue of an object's position in a gravitational field.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Consider a ball with mass $m$ being lifted from the floor to a tabletop of height $h$. The work done by gravity during the ball's ascent was:
    \begin{equation*}
        W_{\text{by gravity}} = -F_{w}h = -mgh
    \end{equation*}
\end{example}
If an object of mass $m$ is raised a height $h$ (which is small enough that $g$ stays essentially constant over this height change), then the increase in the object's $U_{\text{grav}}$ is:
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta U_{\text{grav}} = mgh
\end{equation*}
\begin{note}
    This equation does not depend on the path taken by the object. Thus, gravity is said to be a \textbf{conservative} force.
\end{note}

\section{Conservation of Mechanical Energy}
\begin{definition}
    Mechanical energy, denoted by $E$, is the sum of an object's kinetic and potential energies:
    \begin{equation*}
        E = K + U
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
If the net work done by nonconservative forces is zero, the total mechanical energy of an object is conserved:
\begin{equation*}
    K_{\text{i}} + U_{\text{i}} = K_{\text{f}} + U_{\text{f}}
\end{equation*}

\section{Potential Energy Curves}
The behavior of a system can be analyzed if we are given a graph of its potential energy, $U(x)$, and its mechanical energy, $E$:
\begin{equation*}
    K+U=E \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} + U(x) = E
\end{equation*}
which can be solved for $v$, the velocity at position $x$:
\begin{equation*}
    v=\pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{m}[E-U(x)]} 
\end{equation*}

\begin{example}    

Consider the following potential energy curve:

The graph shows how $U$ varies with $x$. A particular value of the total energy, $E = E_{0}$, is also shown.
Motion of an object whose potential energy is given by $U(x)$ and which has a mechanical energy of $E_{0}$ is confined to the region $-x_{0} \le x \le x_{0}$, because only in this range is $E_{0} \ge U(x)$.
At each $x$ in this range, the kinetic energy $K = E_{0} - U(x)$ is positive. however, if $x > x_{0}$ (or if $x < -x_{0}$), then $U(x) > E_{0}$, which is physically impossible because the difference, $E_{0} - U(x)$, which should give $K$, is negative.

This particular energy curve with $U(x) = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$, describes one of the most important physical systems: a simple harmonic oscillator. The force felt by the oscillator can be recovered from the potential energy curve. 
Recall that, in the case of $U_{\text{grav}}$, we defined $\Delta U_{\text{grav}}=-W_{\text{by grav}}$.
In general, $\Delta U = -W$. If we account for a variable force of the form $F = F(x)$, which does the work $W$, then over a small displacement $\Delta x$, we have $\Delta U(x) = -W = -F(x) \Delta x$, so $F(x) = -\frac{\Delta U(x)}{\Delta x}$.
In the limit as $\Delta x \rightarrow 0$, this last equation becomes:
\begin{equation*}
    F(x) = -\frac{dU}{dx}
\end{equation*}
Therefore, in this case, we find $F(x) = -(\frac{d}{dx})(\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}) = -kx$, which specifies a linear restoring force, a prerequisite for simple harmonic motion. 
This equation, $F(x) = -kx$, is called \textbf{Hooke's law} and is obeyed by ideal springs.

With this result, we can appreciate the oscillatory nature of the system whose energy curve is sketched above.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $x$ is positive (and not greater than $x_{0}$), then $U(x)$ is increasing, so $\frac{dU}{dx}$ is positive, therefore $F$ is negative. 
    So the oscillator feels a force---and an acceleration---in the negative direction, which pulls it back through the origin.
    \item If $x$ is negative (and not less than $-x_{0}$), then $U(x)$ is decreasing, so $\frac{dU}{dx}$ is negative, therefore $F$ is positive.
    So the oscillator feels a force---and an acceleration---in the positive direction, which pushes it back through the origin.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, the difference between $E_{0}$ and $U$ ($K$) decreases as $x$ approaches $\pm x_{0}$, dropping to zero at these points.
The fact that $K$ decreases to zero at $\pm x_{0}$ says that the oscillator's speed decreases to zero as it approaches these endpoints.
It then changes direction and heads back toward the origin---where its kinetic energy and speed are maximized---for another oscillation.
By looking at the energy curve with these observations in mind, you can almost see the oscillator moving back and forth between the barriers at $x = \pm x_{0}$.

The origin is a point at which $U(x)$ has a minimum, so $F = -\frac{dU}{dx} = 0$ at this point, therefore this is a point of equilibrium.
If the oscillator is pushed from this equilibrium point in either direction, $F(x)$ will attempt to restore it to $x=0$, so this is a point of \textbf{stable equilibrium}.
However, a point where the $U(x)$ curve has a maximum is also a point of equilibrium, but it's an \textbf{unstable} one, because if the system were moved from this point in either direction, the force would accelerate it away from the equilibrium position.
\end{example}

\section{Power}
\begin{definition}
    Power is the rate at which work gets done (energy gets transferred).
    \begin{equation*}
        \text{Power} = \frac{\text{Work}}{\text{time}} \text{   or   } P=\frac{W}{t}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{equation*}
        W = \textbf{F} \cdot \textbf{r} \Rightarrow P = \frac{\textbf{F}\cdot \textbf{r}}{t} = \textbf{F} \cdot \textbf{v}
    \end{equation*}
    As a derivative:
    \begin{equation*}
        P=\frac{dW}{dt}
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
\begin{unit}
    The unit of power is the joule per second (J/s), aka the \textbf{watt} (W). One watt = one joule per second.
    \begin{note}
        The W for watt is not italicized, where the $W$ for work is italicized.
