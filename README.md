# Notes
this is my running repo for notes that i take
## Introduction
after a typical highschool sleepless night, i had a shitty idea:
> "what if i, instead of preparing for my important standardized exam coming up tomorrow, started typing notes in LaTeX?"

and so i, a stressed and tired high school student, decided to start making my notes in LaTeX so that i could prepare myself for the onslaught that is secondary education. thus began my obsession with pleasingly formatted notes. then i was like:

> "hey i'm already doing all this work to make these cool notes, what if i let my friends use them too?"

so now it's on this github :D

## Usage
yeah so this directory tree is essentially the template for this stuff
```
/andrwxlin/notes/
|-- subject folder (math, science, etc)
|   |-- topic folder (calculus, physics, etc)
|   |   |-- concept folder (integration, work, etc)
|   |   |   |-- PDF folder (this is the folder you're looking for because it has the readable notes in PDF)
|   |   |   |-- .tex file (this is the source code, outputs are sent to PDF folder)
|-- setup (this is just stuff like the preamble and some formatting things)
|-- README.md (this is what you're reading rn)
```
